## How to download the data:

The dataset is available from the Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford University

Visit the "SEDA Data Downloads" page at https://edopportunity.org/get-the-data/seda-archive-downloads/ (agree to the Data Use Agreement if necessary)

Go to part 2 of the page, "Test Score Estimates: Means, Standard Deviations, and Achievement Gaps"

In the table titled "Test Score Estimations: Means and Achievement Gaps", find the file named "seda_county_long_GCS_v30"

Scroll to the right-most side of the table and download "seda_county_long_GCS_v30" in either Stata or Excel format

Save the data file in the same folder as the do-files (edit the directory at the beginning of the do-files to the folder where the do-files and data are saved)

## Running the analysis:

Run analysis_main.do: this will process the dataset and run the analysis for both mathematics and English Language Arts by calling analysis_math.do and analysis_ela.do
